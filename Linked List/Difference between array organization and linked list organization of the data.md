# Difference between array organization and linked list organization of the data

| Array Organisation | Linked list Organisation |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Basic: It is a consistent set of a fixed number of data items. | Basic: It is an ordered set comprising a variable number of data items. |
| Size: Specified during declaration. | Size: No need to specify; grow and shrink during execution. |
| Storage Allocation: Element location is allocated during compile time. | Storage Allocation: Element position is assigned during run time. |
| Order of the elements: Stored consecutively | Order of the elements: Stored randomly |
| Accessing the element: Direct or randomly accessed, i.e., Specify the array index or subscript. | Accessing the element: Sequentially accessed, i.e., Traverse starting from the first node in the list by the pointer. |
| Insertion and deletion of element: Slow relatively as shifting is required. | Insertion and deletion of element: Easier, fast and efficient. |
| Searching: Binary search and linear search | Searching: linear search |
| Memory required: less | Memory required: More |
| Memory Utilization: Ineffective | Memory Utilization: Efficient |
