# Difference between Static memory allocation and Dynamic memory allocation

| Static memory allocation | Dynamic memory allocation |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| In this case, variables get allocated permanently | In this case, variables get allocated only if your program unit gets active |
| Allocation is done before program execution | Allocation is done during program execution |
| It uses the data structure called stack for implementing static allocation | It uses the data structure called heap for implementing dynamic allocation |
| Less efficient | More efficient |
| There is no memory reusability | There is memory reusability and memory can be freed when not required |
